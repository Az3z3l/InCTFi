# Golden Den

The greatest heist in the town is here. Charlie and his gang have managed to enter into this three-way secured gold vault in Bulgaria. But he is pretty confused with the different layers of security attached to it. The entire challenge consists of breaking into the system by securely accessing the information in each vault. At each level, you will get the pieces of information which together opens the secret vault inside. One of the officers provided him with some crucial files to access the first vault.
